##In this portion of the module I was asked to set the variable '$balance'

# List the variables already defined in the shell.

set

# Create new variable: 'balance'

balance=10000

# Run the set command to check if the variable balance has been created.
set

# At this point the list of recorded variables is so long that it is difficult to comb through

# So I used the pipe command from the previous page

set | grep 'balance'
